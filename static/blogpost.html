                    <p>Last week, I wrote about about the Whatsapp Fallacy, and why zero distribution will not work for 99.9% of companies out there, including yours.</p>
                    <h1>Title example h1</h1>
                    <h2>Title example h2</h2>
                    <h3>Title example h3</h3>
                    <h4>Title example h4</h4>
                    <h5>Title example h5</h5>
                    <p>One of the common reasons / excuses I hear from companies as to why they’re not focused on distribution experiments has to do with the fact that founders think they need a large budget to have meaningful results.</p>
                    <p>We get it. It’s understandable not to want to blow through precious seed dollars with haphazard distro experiments. Don’t do that!</p>
                    <p>But just because you’re on a budget (who isn’t) doesn’t mean you should put off distro experiments until you raise a lot of funds. If you wait that long, you might not be able to raise.</p>
                    <p>Successful experiments can net you results that you can use as a stepping stone to run more segmented experiments, and/or funnel back into product development. The point is to start gathering data immediately.</p>
                    <p>Just like the lean startup methodology, we’re going to launch our ads early (build), read results (measure), and focus on expanding the signals of success (learn).</p>

                    “We don’t know what we’re doing and don’t want to waste money.”
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>This is valid. Most companies starting out don’t have a distribution hacker on demand, and could very well be shooting dollars in the dark.</p>
                    <p>Here’s what happens when you throw out paid acquisition altogether:</p>
                    <p>a) you handicap your product by cutting out a potentially valuable acquisition strategy</p>
                    <p>b) your company misses out on a valuable mine of ongoing feedback and data that could be going towards product development and improved messaging</p>
                    <p>c) you miss out on learning about your messaging, value propositions, and landing pages.</p>
                    <p>At 500 Startups, we believe in starting distribution from day 1.</p>
                    <p>To get you started, here are 4 distro experiments & hacks that the 500 Distribution Team has used to help our 1:1 clients and accelerator companies run distribution experiments and improvements on $10 a day — or less.</p>
                    <h5>#1 Test your conversion funnel</h5>
                    <p>We recommend Mixpanel to a lot of our companies because it gives you free events / people in exchange for you simply putting their logo on your site.</p>
                    <p>HOW TO DO IT</p>
                    <p>Set up events at each step of your funnel and find the weak points in your funnel. Work to improve the weak points first.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <h5>#2 Capture / recapture abandoning users with funnel abandonment emails</h5>
                    <p>Reduce registration friction by only requiring completely necessary fields. This will increase the amount of users entering your product but be aware this will reduce the overall quality of incoming users. The hope is the increase in volume will offset the decrease in quality.</p>
                    <p>COST: Free</p>
                    <p>Wait, you don’t have an email funnel? You should really get on that. But don’t worry, it’s easy to get started with something simple, and still get results right away. (Read about how to suck less at email marketing here.)</p>
                    <h5>#3 Test FB ads at minimal spend</h5>
                    <p>This can be also done through Mixpanel.</p>
                    <p>HOW TO DO IT</p>
                    <p>Set up a people property for the “last step in funnel” that the user takes and email them a customized message when they drop out of the funnel.</p>
                    <p>You can also set up people properties for your best customers to reward them for hitting certain retention goals.</p>
