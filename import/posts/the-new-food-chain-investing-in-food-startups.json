Whether it’s organic,  gluten-free, low carbs, low sodium or if it’s highly social or  tweetable, there is a new food economy emerging today.</p>\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1116715769\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"CultureKitchen class in action \"]<a href=\"http://500.co/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/ck-blog-pic.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1116715769\" title=\"CultureKitchen class in action \" src=\"/backup/ck-blog-pic-300x199-2011-07-20-11-22-16.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" /></a>[/caption]\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Inspired by insights from our last event, “<a href=\"../2011/06/30/highlights-from-our-designing-a-healthy-startup-event/\">Design a Healthy Startup: Prevent Burnout,</a>”  we decided to take a look at the world of food and technology and what  kinds of investment opportunities there are today.
