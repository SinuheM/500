While every business is different, one thing is usually certain: if you can't articulate how you'll grow your business, you're not likely to get the money to do just that. Thankfully, 500 is here to help.\n\nPreviously we covered some of the main DO's and DONT's in \"<a href=\"http://500.co/2013/07/02/how-to-talk-to-investors-about-marketing-and-growth/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Talk to Investors about Marketing and Growth</a>\". To continue that discussion, we're releasing slide templates for talking about marketing within your pitch deck. Since every business is very different, we don't recommend using these verbatim; instead use them as inspiration for talking about how you know your shit, at least with respect to marketing and growth.\n<h2>Covering your Acquisition Sources</h2>\nYou've been testing a lot of different acquisition sources like a good founder, right? Here's your chance to show off everything you've learned AND your ability to track where your users/customers/dollars are coming from. Also be sure to highlight what channels <strong>don't</strong> work so investors know you're ready to focus on the right channels.\n\n<img alt=\"500-Distro-Slides-1\" src=\"/backup/500-Distro-Slides-1-2013-09-24-13-14-16.png\" width=\"593\" height=\"442\" />\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>Talking Paid Acquisition</h2>\nFor startups that grow through a CPL (cost per lead) model a table like the below is typically helpful. It shows the performance on a per-channel basis and helps investors extrapolate the costs involved in scaling your business.\n\n<img alt=\"500-Distro-Slides-2\" src=\"/backup/500-Distro-Slides-2-2013-09-24-13-14-16.png\" width=\"594\" height=\"445\" />\n\n<hr />\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Getting Social</h2>\nSocial channels for most statups don't really move the needle. However, they do help validate there is consumer or other interests in your business. I usually recommend not going overboard with multiple slides on your social media prowess. But if you have a huge audience, show it off by channel breakdown and  an aggregate audience number. It's also a good idea to show off a piece of \"social media flare\" like a posting that had very high engagement/virality.\n\n<img alt=\"500-Distro-Slides-4\" src=\"/backup/500-Distro-Slides-4-2013-09-24-13-14-16.png\" width=\"587\" height=\"442\" />\n\n<hr />\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Paid Acquisition for Subscription Models</h2>\nIf you're a subscription-based business, your ability to grow and acquire ROI positive customers is key. You'll want a simple slide that ideally shows your subscriber growth increasing while your acquisition cost is decreasing. Your acquisition costs will rise as you scale, so it's important to show they're manageable in those early days.\n\n<img alt=\"500-Distro-Slides-3\" src=\"/backup/500-Distro-Slides-3-2013-09-24-13-14-16.png\" width=\"591\" height=\"444\" />\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>Showing Off Your Peeps</h2>\nHere's the slide that always got me the most \"ohs\" and \"ahs\" while pitching. I took a simple DIY map from <a href=\"http://batchgeo.com/\">Batch GEO</a> to create a state-by-state breakdown of where my customers were. It's good to know this data as a founder, and  – most importantly – investors love to see that you know it.  Think of some ways you uniquely visualize who your customers\\users\\members are and other valuable insights about them.\n\n<img alt=\"500-Distro-Slides-5\" src=\"/backup/500-Distro-Slides-5-2013-09-24-13-14-16.png\" width=\"592\" height=\"445\" />\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>What's Next and Use of Proceeds</h2>\nWhen you get to end of your marketing-related discussions on the pitch deck, it's important to address what's next. How are you going to use the money raised? More importantly, how are you going to use their money to make more money/users/fame? Here are 3 recommended sections to think about and potentially address.\n\n<img alt=\"500-Distro-Slides-6\" src=\"/backup/500-Distro-Slides-6-2013-09-24-13-14-16.png\" width=\"596\" height=\"445\" />\n\n<hr />\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe hope these templates are helpful as you think about talking to investors. We know every business is unique, but almost everyone can benefit from better communicating how they're going to grow. Good luck, and happy funding+growing.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/ampptilmyqgh6hd/Marketing%20Slides.pptx\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1116729745 alignnone\" alt=\"download\" src=\"/backup/download-2013-09-24-13-14-16.jpg\" width=\"178\" height=\"61\" /></a>(PowerPoint Version)\n\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/e5ymoozncbki4p4/Marketing%20Slides%20Keynote.key\"><img alt=\"download\" src=\"/backup/download-2013-09-24-13-14-16.jpg\" width=\"178\" height=\"61\" /></a>(Keynote Version)\n\n&nbsp;",
