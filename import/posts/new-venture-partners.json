    "content": "In case you haven’t heard, we’re now DOUBLING our startup efforts by running simultaneous accelerator programs in Mountain View and San Francisco. It’s gonna be a lot of work (goodbye sleep!), so we decided to convince two crazy people to join the ever-growing 500 Startups team:\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Bitcoin Honey Badger</h2>\n<h2><a href=\"http://500.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/sean-bitcoin.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1116731399\" alt=\"sean bitcoin\" src=\"/backup/sean-bitcoin-1024x576-2014-02-03-14-09-08.png\" width=\"614\" height=\"346\" /></a></h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First up is <a href=\"http://twitter.com/percival\" target=\"_blank\">Sean Percival,</a> who’s a legit internet badass. He launched his first internet startup in 2006 for a mere $12, then sold it in 2009 at an 835,000% return on investment. He was also the CEO and co-founder of 500 Startups company Wittlebee, and spent some time at MySpace as the VP of Online Marketing.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Remember glitter font? He basically invented that.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"/backup/glitter-2014-02-03-14-09-08.gif\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1116731401\" alt=\"glitter\" src=\"/backup/glitter-2014-02-03-14-09-08.gif\" width=\"254\" height=\"145\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Currently, he’s an advisor at <a href=\"http://blockchain.info/\" target=\"_blank\">Blockchain</a> and the founder of <a href=\"http://bubblecoin.biz/\" target=\"_blank\">BubbleCoin.</a> Sean’s one of those crypto currency nerds (and a total overachiever), but that’s kinda why we hired him.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a Venture Partner,  Sean will help us find awesome Bitcoin startups for our accelerator program. Bitcoin is the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r7wHMg5Yjg\" target=\"_blank\">honey badger </a>of money and 500 is the honey badger of startups, so it's a perfect match really. Plus, he has really nice hair. We want to learn all his shampooing secrets so we can look half as fabulous as he does.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you want to hear him talk about glitter font and Bitcoin in person, check him out at our our upcoming <a href=\"http://commercism.co/bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin unconference</a> on March 20.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Super Mentor</h2>\n<h2><a href=\"http://500.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/supermarvin.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1116731397\" alt=\"supermarvin\" src=\"/backup/supermarvin-1024x600-2014-02-03-14-09-08.png\" width=\"614\" height=\"360\" /></a></h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s a bird! It’s a plane! Nope, it’s just <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marvinliao\" target=\"_blank\">Marvin Liao</a>, a former 500 Startup Super Mentor who was in our office so often we just assumed he was already working for us full-time. We figured we might as well pay him for being here so much.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Marvin was at Yahoo for more than a decade (we promise we wont let him change our logo) and has worked in Sales, Biz Dev, Ad Operations, and Marketing all around the globe. He also spent 2 years running online marketing at e-commerce startup Alibris.com (now Monsoon Commerce).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a Venture Partner, he’ll use his x-ray vision to help us find startups for our next 500 batches, and will keep our companies away from kryptonite (aka bad sales and crappy marketing).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Think Marvin and Sean would love your startup? Show ‘em what you got applying for our next batch in Mountain View. Do it here: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/Getin500\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/Getin500</a> (applications close on Friday February 21 at 11:59PM PST!)</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Join us in welcoming them to the team!</p>",
