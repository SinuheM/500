Since then, more than 100 have taken the challenge and WIN has sparked a ton of <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/18/women-in-tech-put-your-money-where-your-mouth-is/\" target=\"_blank\">exciting conversation</a> around the topic of women angels and women investors.\n\nTo keep up the momentum, we’re introducing our new Wednesday blog series, <strong>WIN Wednesdays</strong>. Beginning next Wednesday, we’ll highlight a notable female leader in tech each week. Whether she’s an angel investor, a founder, an engineer, or a warrior princess that fights crime with a Macbook Air, the featured WIN Wednesday woman will always be someone that we think is an inspiration and awesome role model for women (and men) everywhere!\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://500.co/2012/07/26/win-wednesdays/xena-large-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1116721291\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1116721291\" title=\"xena-large\" src=\"/backup/xena-large-2012-07-26-12-04-10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"502\" height=\"377\" /></a></p>",
