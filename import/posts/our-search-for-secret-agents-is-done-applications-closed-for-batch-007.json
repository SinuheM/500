    "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Did you make time to get your application in for our Fall Accelerator batch? We hope so – because applications CLOSED last night at 11:59pm PST. Over the last month, we’ve received hundreds of applications from potential secret agents, and we can’t wait to see who has what it takes to be part of next global team of badass founders – Batch 007.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you applied, be on the lookout for an email from us sometime soon. We’ll do our best to contact all applicants about their status over the next few weeks. For those curious about our next batch, check out the <a href=\"http://500.co/blog/\">500 Blog</a> over the next month or so for news about the #500Strong agents of Batch 007.</p>\nDidn’t make it this time, but still aspire to join our global network of not-so-secret founders? Applications for the Spring 2014 batch will open up later this fall, so keep checking back.",
