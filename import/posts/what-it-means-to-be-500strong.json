We also occasionally go out for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm301fDzxwc\">epic, all-night karaoke sessions together</a>, but that’s just on the side.\n\nOver the next few weeks, we’re going give you a glimpse into what goes on behind the scenes at 500 – who we are, who our companies are, what makes us tick, and what investment themes get us hot and bothered (even when others think they’re boring or unsexy). This will give you an idea of all the amazing stuff the #500Strong family is doing all over the globe, so <a href=\"http://www.500.co/blog\">keep your eyes on the blog</a> over the next month for new content every day!",
