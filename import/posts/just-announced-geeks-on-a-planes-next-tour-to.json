A private, invite-only tour for selected startups, investors, and executives, GOAP is an exploratory program to learn about business opportunities in burgeoning international technology markets. We review hundreds of applications and then hand-pick an influential group who travel by planes, trains, and automobiles to meet with thousands of local entrepreneurs, companies, and government officials to share experiences and learn how we can work together to move technology innovation forward. The result: a lifelong bond with fellow travelers, a wealth of new friends and business contacts in exploding technology markets, and a stronger appreciation for the cultural and economic ties that bind us globally.</p>\nOur next tour is GOAP Middle East from November 1st - 12th, making stops in Dubai, Tel Aviv, Istanbul &amp; Amman.\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/500startups.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&amp;formkey=dGh3VjRGQkZuN3RiRHF5WU1pOERRU1E6MA#gid=0\">APPLY HERE FOR GOAP MIDDLE EAST BY SEPT 28th! </a></strong>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://geeksonaplane.com/destinations/2012-destinations/middle-east-2012/\">\n</a></p>",
