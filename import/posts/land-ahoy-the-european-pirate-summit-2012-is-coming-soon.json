Like-minded Pirates, amazing speakers, and the gritty atmosphere of a mind blowing venue made it a startup conference like none other. Check out this video:</p>\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/KE3oQicSVX8\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>\nLars Hinrichs was totally amazed and tweeted: “coolest underground pitching area ever”, Deutsche-Startups decided EPS was the “<a href=\"http://www.deutsche-startups.de/2011/12/20/pirate-summit-veranstaltung-des-jahres/\">startup event of the year</a>”, and Mike Butcher said “<a href=\"http://piratesummit.com/recap-2011/\">it was the rebirth of the tech scene in Europe</a>”.\nThis year’s edition looks even more promising. Under the motto “ARRR on Europe”, the EPS is bringing together approx. 500 Europeans who have demonstrated their Pirate spirit, led their excursions to success, and took home the loot (have a look at “<a href=\"http://piratesummit.com/who%E2%80%99s-a-pirate/\">Who’s a pirate?</a>”). Among them you will find top-notch Pirates as Saul Klein, Lars Hinrichs, Klaus Hommels, Andreas Ehn, Stefan Glaenzer and <a href=\"http://piratesummit.com/speaker/\">many more</a>.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The <a href=\"http://piratesummit.com/program/\">program</a> of the two days event is fully packed with talks, discussions, workshops, and pitches. Both business and tech focused mates will get their money’s worth: Among others, the European Pirate Summit 2012 will show how to successfully beat global players and their monopolies, let 11-14 years old developers present their newest iOS apps and disclose why grog tastes like shit aboard accelerators.\n<a href=\"http://500.co/2012/09/03/land-ahoy-the-european-pirate-summit-2012-is-coming-soon/sebastian-stier-pitching-codesustainable/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1116722809\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1116722809 aligncenter\" title=\"Sebastian Stier pitching codesustainable\" src=\"/backup/Sebastian-Stier-pitching-codesustainable-300x224-2012-09-03-12-17-40.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" /></a>\nWithout a doubt the pitch competition was one of the highlights at the last European Pirate Summit. Startups such as <a href=\"http://www.popset.com/\">Popset</a>, <a href=\"http://getgauss.com/\">Vocalytics</a>, <a href=\"http://readmill.com/\">Readmill</a>, <a href=\"http://bonusbox.me/\">Bonusbox</a> and many more put up an incredible show on stage. Today, these companies are docking in harbors around the world, and serve as inspiration for many entrepreneurs. These are <a href=\"http://piratesummit.com/2012/08/27/glory-fame-and-somewhat-more/\">the new warriors</a> to step into the pitching arena.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Are you a pirate?
