Dragons prefer to live by their own rules and if left on their own, are usually successful. They’re driven, unafraid of challenges, and willing to take risks. They’re passionate in all they do and they do things in grand fashion.”</i> (<a href=\"http://www.chinesezodiac.com/dragon.php\">source</a>)\n\nHell to the yeah. <strong>WE ARE 500.</strong>\n\nThe startups of the <a href=\"http://500.co/accelerator\">500 Accelerator batch</a> aren’t just our little monsters. They are DRAGONS. In the 4 months they’ve spent in our Secret Lair, they’ve broken rules. Broken code. Seen many sunrises. Pushed themselves past their limits. FAILED. Even after they leave our doors, they will never forget their dragon nature nor will they lose their passion for building great things.\n\nThis week, the Accelerator companies will unveil their latest at the 500 Demo Days tomorrow and Thursday. The events are invite-only for investors and selected press, but you can tune in from wherever you are via our livestream:\n\n<strong>Wednesday, January 25  1:00pm PST, and</strong>\n<strong>Thursday, January 26  6:00pm PST</strong>\n<strong><a href=\"http://spn.ee/fehcyg\">www.livestream.com/500startups</a></strong>\n\nAlso, one of our dragons <a href=\"http://gizmo.com/\">Gizmo</a> created an awesome HTML5 mobile app on their platform for Demo Day. <a href=\"http://spn.ee/CLrpdN    \">Check it out on your mobile browser here</a> .\n\nFollow <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/500\">@500</a> and our hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23500STRONG\">#500STRONG </a> on the Twittersphere for the latest updates on Demo Day.\n\n(P.S. Happy Lunar New Year)\n\n</div>",
