With that in mind, we’d like to extend a big <strong>\"thank you\"</strong> to the fine folks at <strong>Social Media Week</strong> for giving us a chance to do just this.\n\nAs you may know, Social Media Week is dedicated to bringing people together to discuss all things social. This year SMW kicks off February 7th and runs through the 11th in cities around the world.\n\nWe’re teaming up with <strong>500 Startups</strong> and <strong>House of Air</strong> and inviting a bunch of geeks to an <strong>indoor trampoline park</strong> created from an <strong>old airplane hangar</strong>. Yes, there will be 11ft hoops to dunk on, the most ridiculous dodgeball you've ever seen, <strong>Blue Bottle coffee</strong>, a taco truck, zozi credits for all, comfy t-shirts, <strong>Dave McClure doing flips</strong>, a photographer to catch all the action, and beats being dropped by a<strong>DJ suspended above the crowd</strong> on a steel catwalk.\n\nThe event will be on February 10th, from 4:00 PM – 6:00 PM in San Francisco.<strong> </strong>We’d love to have you join us! It’s going to rock.\n\n<strong>More info here: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/ft8r1V\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/ft8r1V</a></strong>\n\n<strong><img class=\"alignnone\" title=\"Indoor trampoline\" src=\"/backup/hoae-2011-01-28-11-10-05.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"664\" /></strong>",
