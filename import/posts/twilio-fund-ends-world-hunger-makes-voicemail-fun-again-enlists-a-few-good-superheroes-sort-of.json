    "content": "<em>Textaurant, OrderMapper, &amp; Voicendo are the first to receive 100 Benjamins from the Twilio Fund. BOOM!</em>\n\nBack in September, <a href=\"http://500.co/2010/09/23/twilio-fund-for-500-startups/\">we announced the Twilio Fund</a> – a $250K platform micro-fund from 500 Startups that we carved out to invest in startups building on top of the Twilio platform. We’re HUNGRY to share a couple announcements – the first three $10,000 recipients of the Twilio Fund and our Twilio Fund advisors!\n\nAnd now... introducing you to <a href=\"http://textaurant.com/\">Textaurant</a>, <a href=\"http://ordermapper.com/\">OrderMapper</a>, and <a href=\"http://voicendo.com/\">Voicendo</a>!\n\n<a href=\"http://textaurant.com\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1116714557\" title=\"logo_textaurant\" src=\"/backup/logo_textaurant-300x101-2010-12-21-10-16-32.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"101\" /></a>\n<strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> </span></strong>\n\n<strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><a href=\"http://textaurant.com\" target=\"_blank\">Textaurant</a> is changing the way patrons wait - and restaurants fill seats - by allowing customers to wait online, not in line. Patrons can see wait times from any computer or smartphone and can join the queue from anywhere, and receive a text or voice message (powered by Twilio!) when their table is almost ready. Textaurant restaurants lose fewer patrons because of long waits, increasing overall revenue, and add dollars to the top line by offering a unique and convenient service. The team is currently working with restaurant chains around the country, including American Food Systems (as Cafe Luigi in Bedford, MA) and Finale Desserts in the Boston area, Red Stripe Restaurants in Rhode Island, and Fox Restaurant Concepts (as True Food Kitchen in Scottsdale) in Arizona. </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">They also have a few independent restaurants on board.</span></strong>\n\n<strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><a href=\"http://500.co/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Rockport-065_50pct.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1116714558\" title=\"Rockport 065_50pct\" src=\"/backup/Rockport-065_50pct-300x225-2010-12-21-10-16-32.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></span></strong>\n\nTextaurant has seen a decrease in \"no-shows\" of 5-15% per restaurant on busy nights, and an increase in post-9pm tables seated. Additionally, 90+% of patrons who are asked are willing to give their mobile phone number. Future plans for Textaurant include: a restaurant interface including loyalty features, analytics, and marketing tools; patron accounts; social sharing tools; possibly other verticals beyond restaurants; and of course - more locations!\n\nTextaurant is Josh Bob and Dan Pickett, who met on the Boston entrepreneurship scene in 2009. Josh (CEO) has a background in marketing, business development, and operations, and Dan (CTO) is a lead engineer and development consultant for numerous companies around the country. Both are passionate about food, and both hate waiting - which is why they created Textaurant!\n\nCheck out this clip of Josh Bob on FOX News demoing Textaurant:\n<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/IAot5PMzVQU?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/IAot5PMzVQU?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://ordermapper.com\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1116714565\" title=\"ordermapper\" src=\"/backup/ordermapper-300x159-2010-12-21-10-16-32.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"159\" />\n</a></strong><a href=\"http://ordermapper.com\" target=\"_blank\">Order Mapper</a> is developing a universal, cloud based ordering and marketing API called OrderWiki.  They provide simple mobile ordering for almost any business using a REST API that can be integrated directly into native mobile apps (iOS, Android, WP7).\n\nOrderMapper is disrupting mobile ordering and marketing for restaurants (like GroupOn, GrubHub, and Point of Sale companies), beginning with the launch of their proof of concept app (Order Pizza) and several white label apps (including Round Table, Zeeks and US Pizza Co.) earlier this year, which now have over 30,000 orders between them.\n\nRestaurant owners get full control over menus, pricing, opening hours, delivery areas and reservations. They even run their own marketing, creating offers and demand generation with technologies like Push Notifications (iOS) and C2DM (Android). Their API processes orders via fax, e-mail, POS, or to any phone number using Twilio. Combined with monthly tiered pricing according to order volumes, this gives OrderMapper universal reach with minimal upfront cost to the business. For app developers, it’s an easy way to integrate mobile ordering into any app. Everything is done through standard GET and POST,  transactions are secure and authenticated. OrderMapper is either supporting or partnering with a range of 3rd party services (e.g. PayPal) to give developers as much freedom and flexibility as possible. And for consumers, the platform delivers the level of choice and convenience they’re increasingly demanding. They use their favorite app to order from their favorite local place,  OrderMapper provides the technology expertise to make it happen.\n\nCheck out a video here of OrderMapper in action:\n\n<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/GbdYBj14ea0?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/GbdYBj14ea0?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>\n\n<img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http://twilio.typepad.com/.a/6a0105364227ca970b013488bcb438970c-pi\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"239\" />\n\nOrder Mapper's core team includes Jim Bricker (CEO), John Pitocco (CTO), Simon Taghioff (CMO), and Shahryar Khan (Lead Developer). The team launched their white label apps at the International Pizza Expo in March 2010 in Las Vegas.\n\nHere is Danielle Morrill from Twilio (also a 500 Startups Mentor) demoing OrderMapper:\n<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/6RBp4qw9nl4?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/6RBp4qw9nl4?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>\n\n<a href=\"http://voicendo.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1116714642\" title=\"voicendo\" src=\"/backup/voicendo-2010-12-21-10-16-32.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"252\" height=\"47\" /></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://voicendo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Voicendo</a> provides a user interface for small businesses and independent professionals to manage their incoming phone calls (even SMS) routed according to their easily configured routes! Backed by the scalability and power of Twilio, we're changing small business telephony for the better.\n\nVoicendo enables business to configure their numbers in a hosted, stable, and secure environment, and keep the simple pay-as-you-go model that allows a predictable expense. Features include the ability to setup call schedules (even based on specific contacts, in their address book), simple call forwarding, SMS notifications, voicemail, conferencing to multiple callers at once, \"find me\" type functionality that rings all phones until one answers, custom menus to route calls (using text-to-speech or recorded messages), and several more!  By providing an easy to use interface, combined with a powerful backend and simple billing - we aim to streamline the process of configuring business phone numbers and continuously maintaining them.  With a free iPhone and Android app on the way, we feel anyone could benefit from our services.\n\nVoicendo was created by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/GWIL\" target=\"_blank\">Garrett Wilson</a>.\n\n<strong>It’s A Bird!
