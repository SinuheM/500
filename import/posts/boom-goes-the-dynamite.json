In addition to this amazing new discovery which is awaiting official recognition by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, they are also proud to announce they are in the early stages of developing 12 remarkable new startups in their just-launched 500 Startups Accelerator program at their headquarters in Mountain View.\n\nThe buzz among the science community is the 500 Startups Accelerator will soon eclipse the CERN Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland, which has long held the title of the world’s largest and highest-energy particle accelerator. Several Russian physicists have raised concerns this new 500 Startups Accelerator could be dangerous and has the potential for creating wormholes with unknown outcomes, possibly even the creation of a black hole.\n\nThe 12 startups will be observed at the 500 Startups Accelerator for 3-6 months (in a very large petri dish) as they learn the essentials of designing functional user experience, acquiring happy and engaged customers, instrumenting dashboards to collect business metrics (that go up and to the right), and developing successful online distribution strategies across key search, social, mobile, and email platforms.\n\nSpecs of the 500 Startups Accelerator are detailed below\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Funding: </strong>Funding ranges from $25-100k. Terms will be set at ~5% of equity, or based on pre-existing terms if the startup is already backed by experienced venture investors.</li>\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"http://500startups.com/mentors.php\" target=\"_blank\">Mentors</a></strong>: Startups will have access to a global network of 120+ mentors, several of whom will be speakers in our weekly accelerator curriculum, hold office hours, 1:1 mentoring, and otherwise available to help and guide our startups. For more info see.  In addition, about 10-15 of our mentors are “Mentors In Residence” and work from our space on a weekly basis.</li>\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tsbISFI6-s\" target=\"_blank\">Workspace</a></strong>: The 500 Startups space was designed to encourage a culture of prototyping, creativity and collaboration. We're located in downtown Mountain View with proximity to top investors, platform companies, Stanford University, public transportation, and startup-friendly food.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Design Network:</strong> We're piloting a menu of scalable design resources that produce measurable results for our startups including UX reviews, Designers-In-Residence, and more. We recently held a Lean UX Design Bootcamp in collaboration with the <a href=\"http://dschool.stanford.edu/\">Stanford d.school </a>and <a href=\"http://luxr.posterous.com/\">LUXr</a>. Among our yearly events &amp; conferences includes <a href=\"http://www.warmgun.com/%20\">Warm Gun</a>, a one-day conference on measurable design.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Distribution Platforms</strong>: Startups need scalable, cost-effective customer acquisition. We specialize in distribution for search, social, mobile, and email platforms. A number of our mentors hail from major distribution platforms including Facebook, Twitter, Google, and YouTube and and serve as an invaluable resource to our startups.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Education, Events, &amp; Community:</strong> We've developed a <a href=\"http://plancast.com/500startupsaccelerator\" target=\"_blank\">curriculum of weekly talks and office hours</a> along with large quarterly conferences focused on design, data, and distribution. These help to instill strong community and camaraderie among our founders and mentors.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Annual Sponsors &amp; Partners:</strong> We're working with companies who will be closely involved in the accelerator program via hands-on assistance, product support, and more. Annual sponsors and partners include VIP partner Rackspace Hosting, as well as Microsoft BizSpark, Gunderson Dettmer, and Amazon Web Services.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Investor Demo Day: </strong>Accelerator startups will present at our first investor demo day, to be held at 500 Startups on April 6-7, 2011. Mark your calendars!</li>\n\t<li><strong>Startups interested in applying to the program:</strong> We don't have an open application process process. Startups get in through referrals from people we trust. (ex. our mentors, venture advisors, founders, etc)</li>\n</ul>\nTo learn more, visit <a href=\"http://www.500startups.com/accelerator\">http://www.500startups.com/accelerator</a>\n\nA little bit about the startups in this founding accelerator batch:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.internmatch.com\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1116714974\" title=\"InternMatch\" src=\"/backup/internmatch1-2011-02-10-11-17-06.png\" alt=\"InternMatch\" width=\"276\" height=\"80\" /></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.internmatch.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.internmatch.com</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.internmatch.com\" target=\"_blank\"></a>InternMatch's mission is to help college students discover amazing internships.\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Founded by:</strong> Andrew Maguire, Nathan Parcells, and Kyle Wilkinson</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hails from</strong>: Seattle, WA</li>\n\t<li><strong>Fun facts:</strong> Andrew spent countless hours during his college years playing speed chess on the streets of NYC, instead of studying for class.
