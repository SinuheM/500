If that’s the case, the speakers at this event were some of the richest women in Silicon Valley with plenty of stories of how they got started, took risks, failed, persevered, and became who they are today.\n\nThe intention behind the event’s storytelling format was to strengthen the sense of community among women designers while inspiring the next generation (e.g., several high school and college students attended).\n\nHere are a few highlights of the speakers’ journeys and tips for fellow women navigating the world where design, technology, and entrepreneurship intersect.\n<div><strong id=\"internal-source-marker_0.013831327203661203\">Kate Aronowitz, Director of Design at <a href=\"http://facebook.com/\">Facebook</a></strong></div>\nOne of Kate’s first design gigs was photoshoping abs onto muscular men for a Herbal Supplement company. She shared how years later, she turned down the position for Director of Design telling Facebook’s recruiters they needed “a young guy” (not a mom) and gave them a list of five recommendations. They persisted and she finally said yes, when she realized she was in fact the right person for the job.\n\nTips:\nLearn how to code.\nDesign with purpose (which your portfolio should reflect).\n\n<object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F31397384&amp;show_comments=false&amp;auto_play=false&amp;color=ff7700\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F31397384&amp;show_comments=false&amp;auto_play=false&amp;color=ff7700\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /> </object> <span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/womenindesign/kate-aronowitz-director-of\">Kate Aronowitz, Director of Design at Facebook</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/womenindesign\">womenindesign</a></span>\n<div><strong id=\"internal-source-marker_0.013831327203661203\">Nancy Broden, Design Lead for User Growth at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/\">Twitter</a></strong></div>\nNancy was a dancer for many years before she realized it was a great hobby but a “sucky” profession.

Is it true that there is a gender bias in the world of tech startups? It doesn’t matter because the effect remains the same whether or not there is a bias. She referred to “stereotype” threat, a concept validated in social science research, which is when perceived bias (as a result of being the “other”) makes one physiologically anxious and want to leave the situation.\n\nTips:\n\nFor women in tech/design/business fields:\nChange internal narrative by owning what you do.\nDon’t flirt or play the little sister!\n\nFor others:\nAim for 50% female representation. If not, get at least 33% of women in design/tech/startups, which is the critical mass proven in research to reduce stereotype threat.\nNeutralize language. Example: “We believe you would be great to write this piece in Tech Crunch” (note no mention of gender).\n<div id=\"__ss_10671971\" style=\"width: 425px;\">\n\n<strong style=\"display: block; margin: 12px 0 4px;\"><a title=\"Janice Fraser\" href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/womenindesign/janice-fraser\" target=\"_blank\">Janice Fraser</a></strong> <iframe src=\"http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/10671971\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\"></iframe>\n<div style=\"padding: 5px 0 12px;\">View more <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/\" target=\"_blank\">presentations</a> from <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/womenindesign\" target=\"_blank\">Women in Design</a></div>\n</div>\n<object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F31395743&amp;show_comments=false&amp;auto_play=false&amp;color=ff7700\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F31395743&amp;show_comments=false&amp;auto_play=false&amp;color=ff7700\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /> </object> <span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/womenindesign/janice-fraser-founder-of-luxr\">Janice Fraser, Founder of LUXr &amp; Founding Partner of Adaptive Path</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/womenindesign\">womenindesign</a></span>\n<div><strong id=\"internal-source-marker_0.013831327203661203\">Elle Luna, Senior Communication Designer at <a href=\"http://ideo.com/\">IDEO</a></strong></div>\nElle started in a film program before she realized she was most attracted to storytelling, and transferred into graphic design.
