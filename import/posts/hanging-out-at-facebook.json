Lots of fun was had by all, and everyone enjoyed meeting the Facebook team. (as well as the delicious snacks and drinks in the kitchen!)\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1116719038\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\" caption=\"This wall was blank until we showed up.

The rest of the afternoon was filled with great speakers on Open Graph, Facebook Ads, mobile distribution, and more. 500 Mentors Luke Shepard, <a href=\"http://500.co/mentor-profiles/george-lee/\" target=\"_blank\">George Lee</a>, and <a href=\"http://500.co/mentor-profiles/brian-rosenthal/\" target=\"_blank\">Brian Rosenthal</a> were also in attendance.
