Tons of fantastic companies applied from all around the world, and we can’t wait to review everyone’s application.\n\nSo what’s next? If you applied, keep an eye on your inbox for an email from 500 – we’re going to try our best to contact all the applicants about their status over the next few weeks. For everyone else, check the 500 blog over the next month or so for exciting news about the #500Strong startups of Batch 6.\n\nDidn’t make it this time, but want in during the next round? We’ll announce applications later this year for our Fall 2013 Accelerator Batch, so keep an eye out.",
