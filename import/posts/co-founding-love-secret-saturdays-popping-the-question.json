We started working secretly <span style=\"color: #444444; line-height: 22px;\">on Saturdays i</span>n an office from another business I had. It was really exciting.</div>\n&nbsp;\n<div>The coolest part it was when we came to Silicon Valley on a 1-way plane ticket. We didn't buy a ticket to go back to Mexico because we wanted to see where the adventure takes us. Finally  we convinced Dave during a demo day from a previous incubator in Mexico to bring us into the 500 family.  It was a great week, we got into the top 10 of educational games in the US app store and we got accepted to 500 too, so cool!</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>I Popped the Question </strong></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div><em>This story is by <a title=\"http://twitter.com/ladylexy\" href=\"http://twitter.com/ladylexy\">Alexa Andrzejewski</a> on how she met <a title=\"https://twitter.com/teddyg\" href=\"https://twitter.com/teddyg\">Ted Grubb</a>.

I was a designer at Adaptive Path, but I couldn't actually build things. I set out to find a cofounder by sharing my idea with anyone who would listen. I soon realized that I didn't even know what to look for in a developer. Luckily, one afternoon at an Adaptive Path happy hour, I overheard this guy Ted talking about a food app he was working on. I jumped in to share my idea. He liked the idea and agreed to help me figure out what to look for in a technical co-founder. A few months later, I thought, \"Hmm, it sounds like YOU would be the perfect cofounder!\" Over pizza at Flour + Water, I popped the question, and a few weeks later, Ted said yes!</div>\n&nbsp;\n<div></div>",
