It isn’t just something we say in press to make ourselves look good, or a poster we put up in our office. It is in our DNA. When it comes to women, leveling the playing field is something we’re insanely passionate about –  supporting both women founders AND women investors. In the last 4 years, we’ve backed over 100 women-led companies like <a href=\"http://www.wildfireapp.com/\">Wildfire</a>, <a href=\"https://www.taskrabbit.com/\">TaskRabbit</a>, <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/\">SlideShare</a>, <a href=\"http://www.viki.com/\">Viki</a>, <a href=\"http://www.moonfruit.com/\">Moonfruit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.therealreal.com/\">TheRealReal</a>, and i<a href=\"http://www.ipsy.com/\">psy</a>. We even have a significant number of women on the 500 investment team (myself included).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But we’re not satisfied. We want to do MORE.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So today, as we <a href=\"http://500.co/2014/02/13/announcing-500-syndicates/\">roll out our own AngelList syndicates</a>, one of the first syndicates we’re launching is <a href=\"http://angel.co/500-women\">500 Women</a>. Female founders have proven that they know how to build great businesses that make money, especially in markets that male founders (and male investors) tend to ignore.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over the next year, 500 Startups will invest $1M total in 10 women-backed companies (or about $100K each), plus the 500 Women syndicate backers will invest additional capital as well.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We also want to challenge more women to take a seat at the other side of the table - as investors. So far, 500 Women syndicate backers include <a href=\"https://angel.co/rashmi-sinha\">Rashmi Sinha</a> (CEO of SlideShare), <a href=\"https://angel.co/prernagupta\">Prerna Gupta</a> (CEO of Khu.sh), and <a href=\"https://angel.co/wei-hopeman\">Wei Hopeman</a> (Asia head of Citi Ventures).<strong> Interested in backing the 500 Women syndicate?

Remember – we woke up like this.\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"/backup/gif-2014-02-13-14-09-15.gif\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1116731457 aligncenter\" alt=\"gif\" src=\"/backup/gif-2014-02-13-14-09-15.gif\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" /></a></p>",
