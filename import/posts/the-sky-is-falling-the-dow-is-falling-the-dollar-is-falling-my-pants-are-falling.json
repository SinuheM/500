And we sure hope China, India, and Brazil are paying next month’s rent.\n\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">So while the rest of the world fiddles, <strong>500 Startups is ON FIRE</strong> (in a good way).</span>\n\nAfter 3 months of beating the crap out of our 2nd batch of startups, they kind of don’t suck and we think they’re ready for <a href=\"http://plancast.com/p/6q4q/500-startups-demo-days-sold-remote-webcast-livestream-url-info\">500 Demo Days this Tuesday &amp; Wednesday</a> (note: we’re sold out, but you can <a href=\"http://www.livestream.com/500startups\">watch from home</a>).  And even if they do suck, we hope you won’t throw too many tomatoes while they pitch their scrawny little startup stories before we kick them out of the 500 nest.  Sink or swim, little monsters, sink or swim...\n\nAgain we’ll have a full house of <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em>blood-sucking VCs &amp; muck-raking paparazzi</em></span>... er, i mean shrewd investors &amp; respected press to cover the demos of our accelerator companies, with a few cameo appearances from select 500 family free of charge.  (did i mention it was free?)\n\nRemember folks: <strong>Coffee is for Closers</strong>.... and <strong>ABC: Always Be Closing</strong>.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-AXTx4PcKI\n\nTune in <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">1pm PDT Tue 8/16</span> &amp; <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">6pm PDT Wed 8/17</span>: <a href=\"http://www.livestream.com/500startups\">http://LiveStream.com/500startups</a>\n\n(ps - be sure to follow <a href=\"http://twitter.com/search/%23500Strong\">#500strong</a> + <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/500startups\">@500startups</a> on the Twitters for more fun &amp; games :)\n\n</div>",
