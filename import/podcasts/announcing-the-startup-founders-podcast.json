    "content": "While we pride ourselves in being a very diverse bunch at 500 Startups, there's one thing all our founders have in common: they all have a story. And not just any story, either –  founders in the 500 family come from all over the world and many different backgrounds to chase their startup dreams. I'm very excited to announce our weekly podcast that will give them a place to share their biggest challenges, interesting anecdotes and advice for fellow entrepreneurs.\n\nYou can find the first 5 episodes below, featuring the kickass founders from <a href=\"http://paybygroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PayByGroup</a>, <a href=\"http://markerly.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Markerly</a>, <a href=\"http://www.vidcaster.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Vidcaster</a>, <a href=\"https://keen.io/\" target=\"_blank\">KeenIO</a> and <a href=\"https://www.chewse.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Chewse</a>.
